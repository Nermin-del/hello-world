This is a hello world tutorial


Hi! Nermin here, just been on cybernetwork for the last decade, still can't find my way back home, so i've started to learn how to code instead. My main mission right now is javascript.
Wondering if the best option is tacos or if a chicken dish is the best way to start the week with. I'll go with the chicken today i think.
